## Objects and Variables

* In Cpp, direct memory access is discouraged. Instead, we access memeory indirectly through an object. An **object**
is a region of storage (usually memory) that has a value and other associated properties.
* Objects can be named or unnamed; a named object is called a **variable**, and an unnamed object is called an
**identifier**.
