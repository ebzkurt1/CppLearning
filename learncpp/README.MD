### heeloworld.cpp
Best project to get started in a programming language; printing "Hello, World!"

To compile the code from the command line, because who needs a IDE when you have the terminal, type:
```shell
g++ -o <name of the compiled document> <name of the cpp file>

g++ -o helloworld helloworld.cpp
```

This command will compile the `helloworld.cpp` script.

To execute your program simply call the executable that you have created.
```shell
./helloworld
```
